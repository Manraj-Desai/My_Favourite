Xerneas and Yveltal - Wikipediaen.wikipedia.org › wiki › Xerneas_and_Yveltal
Normally, Sugimori designs the legendary Pokémon by himself; however, he suffered from artist's block and required assistance from designer Atsuko Nishida to create Xerneas and Yveltal. ... Additionally, both Pokémon have unique attacks: Geomancy for Xerneas and Oblivion Wing for Yveltal.</p>
